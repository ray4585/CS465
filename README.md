# CS465
This is the repository for my SNHU CS465 full stack development class
Architecture

In our full stack project, we utilized Express HTML alongside JavaScript for server-side rendering of dynamic content. This traditional approach was effective for generating dynamic web pages with data fetched from the backend. However, we also implemented a single-page application (SPA) using Angular for the frontend. SPAs offer a more interactive and seamless user experience by loading once and updating content dynamically without full page reloads. While Express HTML is suitable for server-side rendering, SPAs excel in client-side interactivity.

The backend of our project utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database for several reasons. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are well-suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, making them flexible and scalable for our application's needs. Additionally, MongoDB's document-oriented structure aligns well with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), simplifying data storage and retrieval in our JavaScript-heavy stack.

Functionality

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, serves as a lightweight data interchange format that is easily readable by humans and machines alike. It acts as a bridge between the frontend and backend development pieces by providing a standardized format for exchanging data. Throughout our full stack project, JSON was used extensively to pass data between the client and server, ensuring seamless communication and interoperability.

Refactoring code to improve functionality and efficiencies was a key aspect of our development process. By creating reusable user interface (UI) components, such as Angular directives or React components, we were able to streamline development, reduce redundancy, and improve maintainability. These reusable components allowed us to modularize our codebase, making it easier to update and extend functionality across the application.

Testing

Testing API endpoints is crucial for ensuring the reliability and security of a full stack application. Methods for request and retrieval, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, necessitate various types of API testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. Each endpoint must be thoroughly tested to validate its functionality, handle edge cases, and verify proper error handling. Additionally, testing with added layers of security, such as authentication and authorization, adds complexity to the testing process but is essential for protecting sensitive data and ensuring secure API access.

Reflection

This course has been instrumental in helping me reach my professional goals by providing a comprehensive understanding of full stack web development. I have learned and mastered various skills, including frontend and backend development, database management, API design, testing methodologies, and project management. These skills have not only made me a more competent developer but have also made me a more marketable candidate in my career field. I am now well-equipped to tackle complex projects and contribute effectively to the development of innovative web applications.
